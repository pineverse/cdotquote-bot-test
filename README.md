# Twitter Quotes Bot

* ### A Python bot that automatically tweets posts generated using Tracery grammar at regular intervals using the Twitter API.
* ### Can be deployed for free on [Replit](https://replit.com) or on your local machine or server.
* ### This is an alternative for those previously using CheapBotsDoneQuick to run their bot.
* ### Tracery support allows you to run bots that use a more complex .json file.
* ### Now also works with Images/Video bots that directly include the media url in their tracery code.
